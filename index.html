        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education, Society, and Human Development</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Education, Society, and Human Development. I always knew I wanted to do something with education and wanted to choose a path that would allow me to be working with kids and helping them without necessarily being just a teacher. I knew that I wanted to be involved with helping make changes when it came to children and their education. Creating policies that would bring light to those students that get lost in between the lines. My own elementary – high school experience has made me realize that there are so many areas to help other elementary schools improve whether it be improving policies to better fund low-income schools or having more outreach programs to develop schools beyond the minimum.<br><br>

        I was fortunate enough to attend a school within a nice school district however, noticing the district some of my now adult friends grew up I noticed a need for changes to be made. I am very passionate about having equal chances for every student no matter their needs, and being passionate about this and wanting to make my parents proud drives that ambition even more. Education makes us who we are and being a part of the change for a better education Is a goal of mine. Without education there would be no jobs or no opportunities, it is the foundation of branches upon branches of knowledge that has gotten us this far in life. I would love making education more accessible to every child especially in low developed countries and furthermore expand the NO Child Left Behind Act of 2001. I believe that we have the ability to change those policies that have failed our education system even if it is just one step at a time.<br><br>

        The first experience I have with working with children is being a TA for a Special Education classroom. I was working in a classroom 5 days of the week for only an hour a day in a classroom of just 8 students. I spent five months with them and in that classroom, I would work with them by helping the students to read, write, and how to do basic math problems. I was able to focus and have one on ones with the students and notice their behaviors and work with their limitations. Another important note would be with the individual time we were able to focus on their reading abilities and improve at their paste. I also have had experience over the summer of 2017, I volunteered at a Junior Sports Wheelchair Camp and would have many jobs including but not limited to, transporting kids to their designated groups, handling check ins and check outs, learning how to react in emergencies, handing out medications, and much more. I would continue to work with children ages ranging from 6-17 years old and was able to learn how different age groups work. Although I don’t have the most experience yet, with the time spent working with children in a classroom setting already makes me look forward to gaining more experience.
